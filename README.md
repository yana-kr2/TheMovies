# TheMovies
The Movies is the sample app to demonstrate how I tried to implement the Android MVVM Architecture with Retrofit, Coroutines and DI with Hilt also.
The app used the tvmaze.com  API to donwload data. Some techologies such as  Retrofit i used for the first time. 

# Issues
I clearly know, that I have trouble with naming of folders, classes and variables.
 
At this moment I hit the problem with checking of internet connection before data request (I guess, that I need rewrite logic of data request, wich will catch the Internet connection srate)
 
Also, I can't implement pagination and DataBinding right now. It's technology is absolutely unknown for me, and I feel, that I need much more time to research it in depth. 
I could try to implement some code from tutorial or any else source, but I still can't wrap this knowledges my head around.
 
Besides, i had a problem with TMDB (It was the preferred method of getting data, but i ran into a encountered problem)

I'll continue to develop this App to full implement App's requirements (rewrite Retrofit logic, change the API for getting data, implement the pagination and DataBinding, and include the UnitTesting in the project).

# Conclusion
The project is still being developed by me. It will be updgraded soon. The bottom line is I need a advice and/or some minor help. Moreover, I short of electricity=)
